These are the openstreetmaps (OSM) used to calculate distances between addresses.

Currently CT is the only one downloaded for space reasons.
If you want the program to work for other states you can download them from [here](https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america.html)

Put the file in this directory and make sure they follow the naming convention `map.STATE-NAME.osm.pbf`. For example, New York would be `map.new-york.osm.pbf`.

Then rerun the program and you will be able to use New York as well as Connecticut
