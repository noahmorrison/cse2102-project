Role 2 (Noah Morrison)
======

Run

```
$ gradle -q role2:run
```

NOTE: This only works for addresses in CT, if you want to use a different state follow the instructions
[in the resources directory](./role2/src/main/resources)

NOTE: the first time you hit the OK button, the program will take a while (a minute or two) parsing the map into a cache.
This only happens your first time running the program, after it is finished you can even reopen the application and it will be much faster (< 1 second)
